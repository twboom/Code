This is the first release of SynthQuencer!

# What this release brings you:
* An easy-to-use grid sequencer with a sine wave

## Advanced features:
* Change tempo (restart the sequencer after adjusting tempo to apply changes)
* Change tuning
* Transposition (-4, +4 octaves)
* Change wave type (add `?wave=<wave type>` behind the URL, available waves: `sine`(default), `triangle`, `sawtooth`, `square`,)

# How to use:
Go to the website or download the file and open it (in your browser).
Once you are there, click 'Start' and the sequencer will start. To play notes, select the notes you want to play in the grid. They will be played once the gray play marker reaches a selected note.

# Compatibility issues
Due to a bug in Mozilla Firefox ([1567777](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1567777)), the notes do not fade out.

# Known issues
In SynthQuencer are still some know issues, we will try to patch them in a later release.
